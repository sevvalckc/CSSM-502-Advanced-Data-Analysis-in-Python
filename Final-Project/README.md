# Exploring Work-Related Stress Through Unsupervised Text Analysis on Reddit

This repository contains the final project for **Advanced Data Analysis with Python (CSSM502)**.  
The project uses **sentence embeddings** and **unsupervised methods** to explore how work-related stress is articulated in everyday online language on Reddit.

## Data
- **Primary corpus:** English-language Reddit comments obtained from **public Kaggle datasets**.
- Initial pool: ~64,000 comments  
- After cleaning: 59,895 comments  
- Random sample used in analysis: **10,000 comments** 

## Repository Structure
